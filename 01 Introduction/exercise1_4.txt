After having seen the advertisement in the newspaper, Paul enters the brand new video rental store at Kings Street. He asks the salesperson for the original version of "The Parent Trap". The salesperson has a look in the inventory system and finds the video. It is still in the storehouse. While Paul waits in the store, the salesperson goes down to the storehouse and gets the video for him. Paul pays 6$ for 24h and goes home, happily watching the video. Next day, he brings the video back.

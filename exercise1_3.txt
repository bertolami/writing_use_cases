Narrative #1

On my way to the train he walks by the ATM. If there is no queue he puts in his card, enters the six digit pin code and selects the withdraw "200 CHF no bill" option that is proposed by the ATM because it was his last withdraw. He takes off his card, then the money and catches up the train.
